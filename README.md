# ElementalBattle

ElementalBattle is a futuristic two-player game where players will battle using armies of elementals on the battlefield. The game consists of three phases: recruitment, placement on the map, and combat. The first player to lose 30 elementals loses the game. It is important to know that each element has its own strengths and weaknesses, and players must strategize accordingly.

## Getting Started

To play ElementalBattle, simply download and install the game on your device. Once installed, launch the game and choose the "Play" option. You will then be prompted to choose your player character and select your army of elementals.

## Gameplay

### Recruitment Phase

During the recruitment phase, players will select their army of elementals from a pool of available options. Each elemental has a unique set of attributes, including attack power, defense, and special abilities. Players must strategically select their elementals to ensure they have a balanced and effective army.

### Placement Phase

Once the recruitment phase is complete, players will take turns placing their elementals on the battlefield. The battlefield is a grid of squares, and players must strategically place their elementals in a way that maximizes their strengths and minimizes their weaknesses. 

### Combat Phase

During the combat phase, players will take turns attacking each other's elementals. Each elemental has a set amount of health, and players must reduce their opponent's health to zero to defeat them. Players can also use their elemental's special abilities to gain an advantage over their opponent. 

## Winning the Game

The game ends when one player has lost 30 elementals. The remaining player is declared the winner.
